# Android_TaskApp
Simple app I created as a course assignment for learning basics of Android development.

Looking back at it, I can see where I started to figure out how to work with Android and it's quirks.
There is a lot of messy code especially on classes and functions that I created at the beginning, 
but it was a good learning experience,especially Fragments and dynamic UI were things that took a while to figure out.
